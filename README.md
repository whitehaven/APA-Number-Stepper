# APA-Number-Stepper
A way to step numbers like APA style guide says for space savings.

The point is to automatically compe up with minimum space-using number ranges.
(It is assumed that the numbers for this arrangement are sorted ascending and fully inclusive.)
See below:

1 - 3 -> 1-3
4 - 10 -> 4-10
1002232 - 1002991 -> 1002232-991
